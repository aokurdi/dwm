# dwm
This is a backup of my dwm setup, it is a modified version of the Arco linux version, the original dwm 6.2 can be found at suckless.org
systray is installed and activated in this config
add bar padding and bar height options, the patch on suckless.org doesn't work with modification i made so i had to create
my own padding and height functionality.


dwm is simply very suckless and the best!
Tha main feature of this window manager is that it is really not a user friendly wm ;))
if you don't know c language, don't waste your time! go and grab another wm that is more user friendly;
on the other hand, if you are good in c you'll fall in love with this window manager.

remember ===> c language can give you enough rope to hang your self but it is simply the best!
