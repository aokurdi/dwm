# dwm
This is a backup of my dwm setup, it is a modified version of the Arco linux version, the original dwm 6.2 can be found at suckless.org .  
* Systray is installed and activated in this config.  
* Bar padding and bar height options, the patch on suckless.org doesn't work with my configuration, so i had to create
my own padding and height functionality.  
* Auto start enables, just add your autostart apps in the autostart script.  

TODO:
* Enable systray togglling.  
  
DWM is simply a window manager for programmers by programmers, it is truly a suckless wm and the best!  
Tha main feature of this window manager is that it is really not a user friendly wm ;)).  
If you don't know c language, don't waste your time! go and grab another wm that is more user friendly;  
On the other hand, if you are good in c you'll fall in love with this window manager.  

remember ===> c language will give you enough rope to hang your self but it is simply the best!
