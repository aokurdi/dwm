### _The Suckless_ Dynamic Window Manager  

DWM is simply a window manager for programmers by programmers, it is truly a suckless wm and the best!  
Tha main feature of this window manager is that it's _not user friendly wm ;))_.  
If you don't know c language, _don't_ waste your time! go and grab another wm that is more user friendly;  
On the other hand, if you are good in c you'll fall in love with this window manager.  

This is my modifications on the dwm, it is based of the version of [https://arcolinux.com](Arco Linux), the original dwm 6.2 can be found at [https://dwm.suckless.org](Suckless Org) .
